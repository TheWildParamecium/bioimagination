This repository will serve as a source of creativity for small animations and project related to the biological field. These scripts are being done with a Python 3.6.3 installation (and suitable python modules when needed, installed with pip).

Quimiotaxis (Chemotaxis): a python script that builds a biological model of cells of the immune system trying to chase a bacteria. More of this topic can be read here https://www.lifeder.com/quimiotaxis/ (spanish) or here https://www.biologyonline.com/dictionary/chemotaxis (english). It needs math, random, numpy and matplotlib modules in order to work.

Difusi√≥n (Diffusion): python script that builds a computational model showing the process of diffusion, caused by Brownian motion. More of this topic can be read here (spanish) https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Difusi%C3%B3n_simple, here (spanish) https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Movimiento_browniano or here (spanish, more technical approach) http://e-spacio.uned.es/fez/eserv/bibliuned:revista100cias-2005-numero8-5075/El_movimiento_browniano.pdf. Refer to the english versions of wikipedia page for the same entries. It requires numpy (for obtaining array of random numbers, although random module might be used too) and matplotlib in order to work.
